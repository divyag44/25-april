    "### Yes, a matrix can have multiple sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues under certain conditions. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distinct Eigenvalues**: If a matrix has distinct eigenvalues, each eigenvalue typically corresponds to a unique eigenvector. Therefore, for \\( n \\times n \\) matrix with \\( n \\) distinct eigenvalues, there will be \\( n \\) eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Repeated Eigenvalues**: When a matrix has repeated eigenvalues (also known as degenerate eigenvalues), there can be multiple linearly independent eigenvectors associated with each eigenvalue. This means that for a repeated eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\), there may exist multiple linearly independent eigenvectors \\( \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_k \\) such that \\( \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v}_i = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}_i \\) for each \\( i \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complex Eigenvalues**: In cases where the matrix has complex eigenvalues (which occur in pairs due to the complex conjugate roots of the characteristic polynomial), each complex eigenvalue has associated eigenvectors that are also complex conjugates of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Consider matrix \\( \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eigenvalues: \\( \\lambda_1 = 2 \\), \\( \\lambda_2 = 2 \\) (repeated eigenvalues).\n",
    "- Eigenvectors:\n",
    "  - For \\( \\lambda = 2 \\), any vector in the form \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is an eigenvector. Therefore, there are infinitely many eigenvectors associated with \\( \\lambda = 2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the matrix has a repeated eigenvalue \\( \\lambda = 2 \\) with multiple eigenvectors (\\( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\), \\( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The existence of multiple sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues depends on the nature of the matrix, particularly on whether eigenvalues are distinct, repeated, or complex. Each set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors provides unique insights into how the matrix behaves under linear transformations, making eigen decomposition a versatile tool in various applications across mathematics, science, and engineering."
